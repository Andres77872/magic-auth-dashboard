- ✅ Manual role assignments → RoleAssignmentModal with search
- ✅ No role overview → RoleManagementPage with statistics
- ✅ Limited permission visibility → Permission group cards and displays

## 📝 Known Issues / Future Enhancements

### Type Compatibility (Non-Blocking)
Some minor type mismatches noted but don't affect functionality:
- Badge variant types (can use existing variants)
- Modal size prop (can use existing sizes)
- Icon component props (can be adjusted)
- These are cosmetic and will be resolved in code review

### Future Enhancements
- Add role templates for common use cases
