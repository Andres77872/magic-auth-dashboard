## 🔧 Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Dashboard Page Foundation

**Create Main Dashboard Component**
- Build `src/pages/dashboard/DashboardOverview.tsx` as the primary landing page
- Implement responsive CSS Grid layout that adapts to mobile/tablet/desktop
- Create welcome section showing user name, user type, and last login timestamp
- Add system alerts section for important notifications (placeholder)
- Ensure proper integration with existing DashboardLayout wrapper

**Welcome Section Features**
- Personalized greeting based on time of day and user name
- User type badge showing ROOT/ADMIN status with color coding
- Last login information with relative time formatting
- System status indicator (online/maintenance mode)
- Quick link to user profile page

**Layout Considerations**
- Mobile-first responsive design with single column on small screens
- Tablet layout with two-column grid for better space utilization
- Desktop layout with full grid system utilizing sidebar space
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy following design system

### Step 2: Create Statistics Cards System

**StatCard Component Design**

- **Active Projects** (accessible projects for ADMIN users)
- **Active Sessions** (current logged-in users)
- **User Groups** (total groups and average members)
- **System Version** and **Environment** (ROOT only)

### Step 3: Implement Quick Actions Panel

**QuickActionsPanel Design**
- Grid layout with large, touch-friendly action buttons
- Icon-based design with descriptive labels
- Permission-based visibility (ROOT vs ADMIN vs limited access)
- Hover states with additional information tooltips
- Keyboard navigation support for accessibility

**Individual Action Cards**
- **Create User** (ADMIN+) - Navigate to user creation page
- **Create Project** (ADMIN+) - Navigate to project creation page  
- **Manage Groups** (ADMIN+) - Navigate to group management
- **System Settings** (ROOT only) - Navigate to system configuration
- **View Reports** (ADMIN+) - Navigate to analytics/reporting
- **User Management** (ADMIN+) - Navigate to user list/search

**Action Integration**
- Direct navigation to corresponding management pages
- Pre-filled forms where appropriate (e.g., project creation with defaults)
- Breadcrumb integration to show navigation path
- Permission validation before showing actions
- Loading states for navigation transitions

### Step 4: System Health Monitoring (ROOT Only)

**SystemHealthPanel Features**
- Real-time component status monitoring
- Color-coded indicators (green=healthy, yellow=warning, red=critical)
- Expandable sections for detailed metrics
- Automatic refresh every 10 seconds
- Alert notifications for critical issues

**Health Components to Monitor**
- **Database Status** - Connection health, response time, connection pool
- **Cache Status** - Memory usage, hit rate, response time
- **Authentication Service** - Active sessions, login success rate
- **API Performance** - Average response times, error rates
- **System Resources** - CPU usage, memory consumption (if available)

**HealthIndicator Component**
- Traffic light status display with immediate visual feedback
- Detailed tooltips showing specific metrics and timestamps
- Historical status tracking (last 24 hours summary)
- Direct links to system management for issue resolution
- Alert thresholds and notification settings

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### Initial Load Optimization
- Lazy load non-critical dashboard sections
- Prioritize above-the-fold content (welcome + key stats)
- Use skeleton loaders to improve perceived performance
- Cache user preferences and layout state

### Real-time Update Strategy
- Stagger API calls to prevent overwhelming server
- Use intelligent polling (faster for health, slower for stats)
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
- Batch similar requests when possible

### Memory Management
- Clean up intervals and event listeners on unmount
- Limit cached data retention to prevent memory leaks
- Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Use React.memo for expensive components

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Client-Side Permission Handling
- Display content based on user type from auth context
- Hide sensitive statistics from non-ROOT users
- Validate permissions before showing quick actions
- Graceful degradation for insufficient permissions

### Data Exposure Prevention
- Sanitize all API responses before display
- Avoid exposing sensitive system information in errors
- Use generic error messages for security issues
- Implement proper session timeout handling

### API Security Integration
- Include proper authorization headers for all requests
- Handle token refresh seamlessly during dashboard use
- Implement rate limiting awareness for frequent updates
- Log administrative actions initiated from dashboard
