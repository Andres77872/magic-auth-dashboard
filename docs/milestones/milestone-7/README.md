# Phase 7: Group Management

## Overview
**Duration**: Week 7-8 (10 working days)
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ **IN PROGRESS**
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive group management functionality, enabling admins to create, manage, and organize users into groups with permission-based access control.

This phase is essential for providing administrators with advanced user organization tools, from basic user grouping to complex permission inheritance and bulk operations.

**Dependencies**: âœ… Phase 6 completed (Project Management), Phase 5 completed (User Management)

## Sub-Milestones

### ðŸ“‹ [Milestone 7.1: User Groups Interface](7.1-user-groups-interface/README.md)

- [x] Implement server-side pagination, sorting, and searching for groups.
- [x] Develop a "Create Group" page with a reusable form component.
- [x] Add group member management: add, remove, and bulk assign members.
- [x] Build comprehensive group details page with multiple tabs.

### âž• [Milestone 7.2: Group-Based Permissions & Project Groups](7.2-permissions-project-groups/README.md)
**Duration**: Day 6-10 (5 days)

## Integration Points

### Phase 3 Integration (Layout & UI)
- The new group management pages will use the `DashboardLayout`.
- Reusable UI components (`Table`, `Card`, `Button`, `Input`, `Modal`) will be used.
- `Breadcrumbs` will be automatically generated for group routes.
- Navigation menu will include "Groups" item with proper permission filtering.

### Phase 5 Integration (User Management)
- User data will be needed for the `AddMemberModal` component to search and select users.
- Group membership will be displayed in user profile pages.
- Bulk user operations will include group assignment options.
- User permission calculations will include group-inherited permissions.

### Phase 6 Integration (Project Management)
- Project groups will be available for assignment to projects.
- Project details pages will show associated groups.
- Group-based project access will be clearly indicated.
- Project member lists will show group-based access indicators.

### Phase 8 Integration (RBAC)
- Group permission inheritance will be a key feature integrated with the RBAC system.
- Permission matrices will show group-based permissions.
- Role assignments can be made at the group level.
- Permission conflict resolution will handle group inheritance.

## API Endpoints Summary

### âœ… **Available Endpoints** (Ready for Implementation)
```typescript
// Basic group operations
GET /admin/user-groups                    // âœ… List groups
POST /admin/user-groups                   // âœ… Create group
POST /admin/user-groups/{hash}/members    // âœ… Add member
```

### ðŸ”„ **Required Endpoints** (Need Backend Implementation)
```typescript
// Extended group operations
GET /admin/user-groups/{group_hash}       // Group details
PUT /admin/user-groups/{group_hash}       // Update group
DELETE /admin/user-groups/{group_hash}    // Delete group
GET /admin/user-groups/{hash}/members     // List members
DELETE /admin/user-groups/{hash}/members/{user_hash} // Remove member

// Project groups
GET /admin/project-groups                 // List project groups
POST /admin/project-groups                // Create project group
PUT /admin/project-groups/{hash}          // Update project group
DELETE /admin/project-groups/{hash}       // Delete project group

// Advanced operations
POST /admin/user-groups/{hash}/members/bulk      // Bulk member operations
POST /admin/user-groups/{hash}/projects          // Assign to project
DELETE /admin/user-groups/{hash}/projects/{hash} // Remove from project
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complex Permission Inheritance**: Groups with multiple permission sources can create complexity. 
  - *Mitigation*: Clear visual indicators and detailed permission breakdown views.
- **Performance with Large Groups**: Groups with many members may impact performance. 
  - *Mitigation*: Implement virtual scrolling and efficient pagination.
- **Data Consistency**: Multiple group types (user groups vs project groups) may cause confusion. 
  - *Mitigation*: Clear separation in UI and distinct workflows.

### User Experience Risks
- **Accidental Member Removal**: Removing users from groups can impact their access. 
  - *Mitigation*: Clear warnings about access impact and confirmation dialogs.
- **Permission Confusion**: Complex group hierarchies can be confusing. 
  - *Mitigation*: Visual permission inheritance trees and clear explanatory text.
- **Bulk Operation Errors**: Mass operations can have unintended consequences. 
  - *Mitigation*: Preview changes before execution and detailed operation logs.

### Implementation Risks
- **API Dependencies**: Some endpoints may not be implemented in the backend.
  - *Mitigation*: Implement mock services for development and create comprehensive API documentation.
- **Complex State Management**: Group and member state can become complex.
  - *Mitigation*: Use proven patterns from existing user/project management.
- **Performance Issues**: Large datasets may cause performance problems.
  - *Mitigation*: Implement pagination, virtual scrolling, and efficient caching.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Management Strategy
```typescript
// Group-specific hooks
useGroups()         // User group management state
useProjectGroups()  // Project group management state
useGroupMembers()   // Group member management with pagination

// Integration with existing hooks
useUsers()          // For member selection and management
useProjects()       // For project assignment
usePermissions()    // For permission checking and inheritance
```

### API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Service layer structure
services/
â”œâ”€â”€ group.service.ts          // âœ… EXISTING: User group CRUD operations
â”œâ”€â”€ project-group.service.ts  // ðŸ†• NEW: Project group operations
â””â”€â”€ bulk-operations.service.ts // ðŸ†• NEW: Bulk member/permission operations

// New utility functions
utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ group-permissions.ts      // Group permission calculation utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ bulk-operations.ts        // Bulk operation helpers
â””â”€â”€ group-validation.ts       // Group-specific validation rules
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Component organization following established patterns
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ groups/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ GroupTable.tsx         // ðŸ†• Sortable group data table
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ GroupCard.tsx          // ðŸ†• Group overview cards
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ GroupForm.tsx          // ðŸ†• Create/edit group form
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ GroupMembersTab.tsx    // ðŸ†• Member management interface
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ GroupPermissionsTab.tsx // ðŸ†• Permission inheritance view
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ BulkMemberActions.tsx  // ðŸ†• Bulk member operations
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ProjectGroupTable.tsx  // ðŸ†• Project group management

// Permission utilities
utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ group-permissions.ts      // ðŸ†• Group permission calculations
â””â”€â”€ permission-inheritance.ts // ðŸ†• Permission inheritance logic
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For groups with large member lists
- **Optimistic Updates**: For better perceived performance
- **Debounced Search**: To reduce API calls during member search
- **Cached Group Data**: To avoid repeated API calls
- **Batch Operations**: For efficient bulk member management

### Security Considerations
- Permission-based access control for all group operations
- Audit logging for group membership changes
- Input validation and sanitization for group data
- Rate limiting for bulk operations
- Clear permission inheritance visualization to prevent privilege escalation
