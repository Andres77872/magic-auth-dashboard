## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Integration
```typescript
// Project Groups endpoints
GET /admin/project-groups                           // List project groups
POST /admin/project-groups                          // Create project group
GET /admin/project-groups/{group_hash}              // Get project group details
PUT /admin/project-groups/{group_hash}              // Update project group
DELETE /admin/project-groups/{group_hash}           // Delete project group

// Project Assignment endpoints
POST /admin/user-groups/{group_hash}/projects       // Assign group to project
DELETE /admin/user-groups/{group_hash}/projects/{project_hash} // Remove assignment
POST /admin/project-groups/{group_hash}/projects    // Assign project group to project
DELETE /admin/project-groups/{group_hash}/projects/{project_hash} // Remove assignment

// Bulk Operations endpoints
POST /admin/user-groups/bulk-assign                 // Bulk user assignments
POST /admin/user-groups/{group_hash}/members/bulk   // Bulk member operations
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Project Groups Management
interface ProjectGroupsPageState {
  projectGroups: ProjectGroup[];
  selectedGroup: ProjectGroup | null;
  isCreating: boolean;
  filters: ProjectGroupFilters;
}

// Permission Management
interface GroupPermissionsTabProps {
  group: UserGroup;
  onPermissionChange: (permissions: Permission[]) => void;
}

// Bulk Operations
interface BulkOperationState {
  selectedItems: string[];
  operation: 'add' | 'remove' | 'assign' | 'export';
  progress: number;
  isProcessing: boolean;
  errors: BulkOperationError[];
}
```

### Permission Inheritance Logic
```typescript
// Permission calculation utilities
const calculateEffectivePermissions = (
  user: User,
  project: Project,
  groups: UserGroup[]
): EffectivePermissions => {
  // 1. Direct user permissions
  // 2. Group-inherited permissions
  // 3. Project group permissions
  // 4. Resolve conflicts (most permissive wins)
  // 5. Return final permission set
};

const checkPermissionConflicts = (
  permissions: Permission[]
): PermissionConflict[] => {
  // Identify conflicting permissions
  // Provide resolution suggestions
  // Return conflict details for UI display
};
```

### Data Flow for Complex Operations
```typescript
// Bulk member assignment with progress tracking
const useBulkMemberAssignment = () => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState<BulkProgress>({
    total: 0,
    completed: 0,
    failed: 0,
    errors: []
  });

  const assignMembersToGroups = useCallback(async (
    userHashes: string[],
    groupHashes: string[]
  ) => {
    const total = userHashes.length * groupHashes.length;
    setProgress({ total, completed: 0, failed: 0, errors: [] });

    for (const userHash of userHashes) {
      for (const groupHash of groupHashes) {
        try {
          await groupService.addMemberToGroup(groupHash, userHash);
          setProgress(prev => ({ ...prev, completed: prev.completed + 1 }));
        } catch (error) {
          setProgress(prev => ({
            ...prev,
            failed: prev.failed + 1,
            errors: [...prev.errors, { userHash, groupHash, error }]
          }));
        }
      }
    }
  }, []);

  return { progress, assignMembersToGroups };
};
```

### CSV Import/Export Implementation
```typescript
// CSV export functionality
const exportGroupData = async (
  groups: UserGroup[],
  format: 'members' | 'permissions' | 'full'
): Promise<string> => {
  const csvData = groups.map(group => {
    switch (format) {
      case 'members':
        return {
          group_name: group.group_name,
          member_count: group.member_count,
          members: group.members?.map(m => m.username).join(';') || ''
        };
      case 'permissions':
        return {
          group_name: group.group_name,
          permissions: group.permissions?.map(p => p.permission_name).join(';') || ''
        };
      case 'full':
        return {
          group_name: group.group_name,
          description: group.description,
          member_count: group.member_count,
          created_at: group.created_at,
          members: group.members?.map(m => m.username).join(';') || '',
          permissions: group.permissions?.map(p => p.permission_name).join(';') || ''
        };
    }
  });
  
  return convertToCSV(csvData);
};

// CSV import with validation
const importGroupData = async (
  csvContent: string,
  options: ImportOptions
): Promise<ImportResult> => {
  const parsed = parseCSV(csvContent);
  const validated = validateGroupData(parsed);
  const conflicts = checkForConflicts(validated);
  
  if (conflicts.length > 0 && !options.resolveConflicts) {
    return { success: false, conflicts, imported: 0 };
  }
  
  const results = await Promise.allSettled(
    validated.map(group => groupService.createGroup(group))
  );
  
  return {
    success: true,
    imported: results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled').length,
    failed: results.filter(r => r.status === 'rejected').length,
    errors: results
      .filter(r => r.status === 'rejected')
      .map(r => r.reason)
  };
};
```
