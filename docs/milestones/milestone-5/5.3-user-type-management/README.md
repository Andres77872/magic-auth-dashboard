# Milestone 5.3: Advanced User Management

## Overview
**Duration**: Day 8-10
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Implement advanced, ROOT-specific user management features, including management of other administrators, user type transitions, and bulk operations.

This milestone provides top-level administrators with powerful tools for managing the user hierarchy and performing large-scale actions.

**Dependencies**: âœ… Milestone 5.2 completed (User Creation & Management)

## ðŸ“‹ Tasks Checklist

### Step 1: ROOT User Management Features (ROOT only)
- [x] On the `UserForm`, allow ROOT users to create other ROOT users.
- [x] Implement an additional, strong confirmation step (e.g., re-entering password) before creating a ROOT user.
- [x] Ensure a ROOT user cannot delete or deactivate their own account.
- [x] Ensure a ROOT user cannot be demoted by another ROOT user through the UI.

### Step 2: User Type Management
- [x] Add a "Change User Type" action to the `UserActionsMenu`, visible only to ROOT users.
- [x] This action should open a modal to select the new `UserType`.
- [x] Implement the `userService.changeUserType` API call.
- [x] Handle UI updates and edge cases (e.g., what happens when an ADMIN is demoted to CONSUMER).

### Step 3: Admin Project Assignments
- [x] In the `UserForm` (in edit mode for an ADMIN user), add a feature to manage their assigned projects.
- [x] This could be a button that opens an `AssignProjectModal`.
- [x] The modal would list all projects, with checkboxes for assigning/unassigning.
- [x] This functionality will require new service methods and API endpoints (if they don't exist).

### Step 4: Bulk User Operations
- [x] Add checkboxes to the `UserTable` to allow multi-selecting users.
- [x] When users are selected, show a "Bulk Actions" button.
- [x] Implement bulk actions:
    - **Bulk Delete**: Deletes all selected users after a single confirmation.
    - **Bulk Deactivate/Activate**: Toggles the status for all selected users.
    - **Bulk Assign to Group**: Opens a modal to select a group to add all selected users to.
- [x] Use `Promise.all` or a dedicated bulk API endpoint to handle the operations efficiently.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Summary

### Step 1 & 2: ROOT Features & User Type Changes âœ…
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/features/users/UserForm.tsx` - Enhanced with ROOT user creation security
- `src/components/features/users/UserActionsMenu.tsx` - Added "Change User Type" functionality

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Security-First ROOT Creation**: Added password confirmation modal for ROOT user creation
- **Self-Protection**: ROOT users cannot demote themselves or edit their own user type
- **User Type Management**: ROOT-only "Change User Type" menu action with modal interface
- **Permission Validation**: Proper checks using `usePermissions` and `useUserType` hooks
- **Visual Indicators**: Security warnings and info banners for sensitive operations

### Step 3: Project Assignments for Admins âœ…
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/components/features/users/AssignProjectModal.tsx` - New component for project assignment
- `src/components/features/users/UserForm.tsx` - Integrated project assignment for ADMIN users

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Multi-Select Interface**: Search, filter, and select multiple projects
- **Project Management**: View project details (name, description, member count, status)
- **Assignment Display**: Visual representation of assigned projects with tags
- **API Integration**: Uses existing `projectService.getProjects()` method

### Step 4: Bulk Operations âœ…
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/features/users/UserTable.tsx` - Added comprehensive bulk operations

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Multi-Selection**: Checkbox column with "Select All" functionality
- **Bulk Actions Toolbar**: Appears when users are selected
- **Permission-Based Operations**: ROOT users can only be operated on by other ROOT users
- **Bulk Actions Available**:
  - **Delete**: Multiple user deletion with confirmation
  - **Activate/Deactivate**: Status changes for multiple users
  - **Assign to Group**: Group assignment for selected users
- **API Integration**: Uses `adminService.bulkUpdateUsers()` and `bulkDeleteUsers()`

---

## âœ… Completion Criteria
- [x] ROOT users have exclusive access to creating/managing other ROOT and ADMIN users.
- [x] The workflow for changing a user's type is functional and secure.
- [x] Admin project assignments can be updated by ROOT users.
- [x] Bulk actions (delete, status change, group assignment) work correctly on multiple selected users.
- [x] The UI remains performant and responsive during bulk operations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Implementation Results

### Security Enhancements
- **Strong Authentication**: ROOT user creation requires password re-verification
- **Self-Protection**: ROOT users cannot modify their own permissions
- **Permission Validation**: All operations respect user type hierarchy

### User Experience Improvements
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear visual indicators for sensitive operations
- **Efficient Workflows**: Bulk operations reduce time for large-scale user management
- **Responsive Design**: Loading states and proper feedback for all operations

### Technical Integration
- **Service Layer**: Proper integration with existing `userService`, `adminService`, and `projectService`
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper error handling
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with reusable components

### Performance Considerations
- **Bulk API Usage**: Efficient bulk operations using dedicated endpoints
- **Optimized Rendering**: Proper state management to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
