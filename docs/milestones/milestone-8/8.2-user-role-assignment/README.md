GET /rbac/assignments/recommendations/{user_hash}               // Get recommendations
```

### Component Architecture Requirements
```typescript
// AssignmentsPage component structure
interface AssignmentsPageState {
  selectedProject: string | null;
  users: User[];
  roles: Role[];
  assignments: UserRoleAssignment[];
  selectedUsers: string[];
  assignmentMode: 'single' | 'bulk';
  conflictResolution: ConflictResolution | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

// PermissionMatrix component requirements
interface PermissionMatrixProps {
  users: User[];
  permissions: Permission[];
  userPermissions: Map<string, Set<string>>;
  onPermissionClick: (userId: string, permission: string) => void;
  showInheritance?: boolean;
  highlightConflicts?: boolean;
  filterOptions: MatrixFilterOptions;
}

// BulkAssignmentTool specifications
interface BulkAssignmentToolProps {
  projectHash: string;
  availableRoles: Role[];
  selectedUsers: User[];
  onAssignmentComplete: (results: AssignmentResult[]) => void;
  onCancel: () => void;
  templateOptions: AssignmentTemplate[];
}
```

### Data Management Patterns
```typescript
// useUserRoleAssignments hook implementation
const useUserRoleAssignments = (projectHash: string) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<UserRoleAssignmentState>({
    assignments: new Map(),
    effectivePermissions: new Map(),
    conflicts: [],
    loading: false,
    error: null
  });

  const assignUserToRole = useCallback(async (userId: string, roleId: string, reason?: string) => {
    setState(prev => ({ ...prev, loading: true, error: null }));
    try {
      const result = await userRoleService.assignRole(userId, projectHash, roleId, reason);
      setState(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        loading: false,
        assignments: new Map(prev.assignments.set(userId, [...(prev.assignments.get(userId) || []), result]))
      }));
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      setState(prev => ({ ...prev, loading: false, error: error.message }));
      throw error;
    }
  }, [projectHash]);

  const bulkAssignRoles = useCallback(async (assignments: BulkAssignmentData[]) => {
    // Implementation for bulk assignment with progress tracking
  }, [projectHash]);

  return { 
    ...state, 
    assignUserToRole, 
    bulkAssignRoles,
    // Additional utility functions
  };
};
```

- **Debounced Operations**: Debounce search and filtering operations to minimize API calls
- **Memoized Components**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders in complex permission matrix displays
- **Background Processing**: Process bulk operations in background with progress reporting

### Error Handling Requirements
