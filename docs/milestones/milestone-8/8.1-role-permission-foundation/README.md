## 🎯 Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Integration
```typescript
// Core RBAC endpoints for implementation
GET /rbac/projects/{project_hash}/permissions     // List project permissions with category filtering
POST /rbac/projects/{project_hash}/permissions    // Create custom permission with validation
GET /rbac/projects/{project_hash}/roles           // List project roles with hierarchy info
POST /rbac/projects/{project_hash}/roles          // Create role with permission assignment
GET /rbac/projects/{project_hash}/summary         // Comprehensive RBAC summary for dashboard
POST /rbac/projects/{project_hash}/initialize     // Bootstrap default RBAC configuration
GET /rbac/projects/{project_hash}/audit           // RBAC audit log with filtering support
```

### Component Architecture Requirements
```typescript
// PermissionsOverviewPage component structure
interface PermissionsOverviewPageState {
  selectedProject: string | null;
  rbacSummary: RBACProjectSummary | null;
  recentActivity: AuditEntry[];
  quickActions: QuickAction[];
  healthStatus: RBACHealthStatus;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

// RoleForm component requirements
interface RoleFormProps {
  mode: 'create' | 'edit';
  projectHash: string;
  initialData?: Partial<Role>;
  availablePermissions: Permission[];
  onSubmit: (data: RoleFormData) => Promise<void>;
  onCancel: () => void;
  isSubmitting?: boolean;
}

// PermissionTable component specifications
interface PermissionTableProps {
  permissions: Permission[];
  projectHash: string;
  onEdit: (permission: Permission) => void;
  onDelete: (permissionId: string) => void;
  onDuplicate: (permission: Permission) => void;
  loading?: boolean;
  filters: PermissionFilters;
  onFiltersChange: (filters: PermissionFilters) => void;
}
```

### Data Management Patterns
```typescript
// useRBAC hook implementation pattern
const useRBAC = (projectHash: string) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<RBACState>({
    summary: null,
    permissions: [],
    roles: [],
    auditEntries: [],
    healthStatus: null,
    loading: false,
    error: null
  });

  const initializeProjectRBAC = useCallback(async (config: RBACInitConfig) => {
    // Implementation with progress tracking and error handling
    setState(prev => ({ ...prev, loading: true, error: null }));
    try {
      const result = await rbacService.initializeProjectRBAC(projectHash, config);
      setState(prev => ({ ...prev, loading: false, summary: result.summary }));
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      setState(prev => ({ ...prev, loading: false, error: error.message }));
      throw error;
    }
  }, [projectHash]);

  const refreshRBACData = useCallback(async () => {
    // Implementation for data refresh with optimistic updates
  }, [projectHash]);

  return { 
    ...state, 
    initializeProjectRBAC, 
    refreshRBACData,
    // Additional utility functions
  };
};
```

### Error Handling Requirements
- Comprehensive error boundaries for all RBAC management components
- User-friendly error messages with specific guidance for resolution
- Optimistic UI updates with automatic rollback on operation failure
- Loading states for all async operations with progress indicators
- Form validation with real-time feedback and conflict detection

### Performance Optimization Strategy
