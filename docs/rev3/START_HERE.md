## 🏃 Quick Start for Developers

### Phase 4 (Current Priority): Integration & Testing

**Goal:** Integrate and test the new services

**Steps:**

1. **Review Implemented Services**
   ```bash
   # Services are already implemented:
   # - src/services/global-roles.service.ts (22 methods)
   # - src/services/permission-assignments.service.ts (17 methods)
   # - src/types/global-roles.types.ts
   # - src/types/permission-assignments.types.ts
   ```

2. **Write Unit Tests**
   - Test all methods in global-roles.service.ts
   - Test all methods in permission-assignments.service.ts
   - Target: >80% code coverage
   - Use Vitest framework

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test service interactions
   - Test with backend API
   - Verify error handling
   - Test edge cases

4. **UI Integration**
   - Update permission checking hooks
   - Integrate into existing components
   - Add feature flags
   - Update context providers

5. **Documentation & Review**
