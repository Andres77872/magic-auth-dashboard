## 🎓 Learning Resources

### For Understanding the Architecture

1. **Read the API docs** in order:
   - Start with Authentication
   - Then User Management
   - Then Project Management
   - Finally Global Roles and Permissions

2. **Study existing services:**
   - `auth.service.ts` - Excellent example
   - `user.service.ts` - Complete implementation
   - `project.service.ts` - Clean patterns

3. **Review the blueprints:**
   - See how services should be structured
   - Learn the TypeScript patterns
   - Understand error handling

### For Implementation

1. **Start small:** Implement Project Groups first
2. **Test early:** Write tests as you code
3. **Document:** Add JSDoc comments immediately
4. **Review:** Get feedback early and often
