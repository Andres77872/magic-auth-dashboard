- Expandable sections for detailed metrics
- Automatic refresh every 10 seconds
- Alert notifications for critical issues

**Health Components to Monitor**
- **Database Status** - Connection health, response time, connection pool
- **Cache Status** - Memory usage, hit rate, response time
- **Authentication Service** - Active sessions, login success rate
- **API Performance** - Average response times, error rates
- **System Resources** - CPU usage, memory consumption (if available)

**HealthIndicator Component**
- Traffic light status display with immediate visual feedback
- Detailed tooltips showing specific metrics and timestamps

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### Initial Load Optimization
- Lazy load non-critical dashboard sections
- Prioritize above-the-fold content (welcome + key stats)
- Use skeleton loaders to improve perceived performance
- Cache user preferences and layout state

### Real-time Update Strategy
- Stagger API calls to prevent overwhelming server
- Use intelligent polling (faster for health, slower for stats)
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
- Batch similar requests when possible

### Memory Management
- Clean up intervals and event listeners on unmount
- Limit cached data retention to prevent memory leaks
- Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Use React.memo for expensive components

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Client-Side Permission Handling
- Display content based on user type from auth context
- Hide sensitive statistics from non-ROOT users
- Validate permissions before showing quick actions
- Graceful degradation for insufficient permissions

### Data Exposure Prevention
- Sanitize all API responses before display
- Avoid exposing sensitive system information in errors
- Use generic error messages for security issues
- Implement proper session timeout handling

### API Security Integration
- Include proper authorization headers for all requests
- Handle token refresh seamlessly during dashboard use
- Implement rate limiting awareness for frequent updates
- Log administrative actions initiated from dashboard
